We are SmartMatter.  Our mission is to create an intelligent system of telemedicine for physical therapy patients, 
we have been talking to orthopedists and their patients to ideate viable and functional solutions for remote orthopedic care. 
In 2016, 11.3 million people in the US went in to outpatient physical therapy treatment.  
Self reported patient compliance ranges from 60% to 91% depending upon patient demographics.  
Physical therapists are losing patients because of lack of home support and recovery feedback. 
We spoke to over 25 patients to determine common problems and solutions in PT.  
Patients wanted a way of remote communication with their doctor, a means of getting direct instruction, 
feedback, video conference, precise analytics, clear comparisons, review progress on their recovery process.
